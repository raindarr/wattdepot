# Introduction #

WattDepot has three types of components:

  * a server for storing data
  * sensors for retrieving data from meters and storing in the server
  * clients for retrieving and visualizing sensor data

There are two ways that you can run the WattDepot server:

  * Run it on a server that you provide. If you already have access to a server, this may be the easier and cheaper option. Follow the [local install instructions](InstallingWattDepotServerLocally.md)
  * Run it in the cloud on [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/). If you don't have access to an existing server, and want a more turnkey solution, Heroku might be the answer. Follow the [Heroku install instructions](InstallingWattDepotServerOnHeroku.md)
